## ZADANIE 1
**CTRL+SHIFT+K** - to compile the file

Wy
```{r cars}
install.packages('sf')
install.packages("raster")
```

## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
